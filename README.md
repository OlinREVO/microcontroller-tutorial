Microcontroller Tutorial
========================

Create the following two scripts:

1. Make pin PB2 high and turn on a LED connected to that pin.
2. Set multiple pins high, and turn on 3 leds connected to your atmega.
2. Create an interrupt that will turn the LED on and off when pushing a 4-pin button.

Stretch:
Take a look at the UART documentation and scripts. Implement uart into your script that will print "Button Pressed!" every time the physical button is pushed.

Look at the other scripts in the REVO git to get an idea of the syntax of C.
The documentation folder contains useful stuff for figuring out how to do this.
