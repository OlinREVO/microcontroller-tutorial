Flashing Your Files!
=========================

To flash code onto an ATmega chip, run the following commands:
	-make FILE=client flash for the client
	-make FILE=server flash for the server
You may need to append sudo to these commands based on your system setup. You can
similarly flash the demo node codes to use the multiple node model.

The colors on the programmer are as follows:
Red = power
Orange = ground
Yellow = 1
Green = 2
Blue = 12
Purple = 31

Keep in mind that some of the boards may be numbered wrong, the purple wire always goes to
the pin with the resistor on the left side of the PCB.
